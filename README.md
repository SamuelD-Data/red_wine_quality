# Red Wine Quality Project

## About this project
***

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more details, consult the reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

## Goal
***

- Create a model that can effectively predict the general quality of a wine (good or bad)

## Data Dictionary
***

alcohol - The percent of alcohol within the wine.

chlorides - The amount of salt in the wine.

citric acid - The citric acid level of the wine. Low levels can add 'freshness' and flavor.

density - The density of the wine. 

fixed acidity - The fixed acidity level of the wine.

free sulfur dioxide - The free sulfur dioxide level present within the wine. 

is_good_wine - Boolean column that reflects if a wine is bad (quality 1 - 5) or "good" (quality 6 - 10). (0 == Bad, 1 == Good)

pH - Describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic).

quality - Quality of wine based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10.

residual sugar - The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation has concluded.

sulphates - The sulphate level present within the wine. 

total sulfur dioxide - The total sulfur dioxide level present within the wine. 

volatile acidity - The volatile acidity level of the wine. Too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.
